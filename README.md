# CS936Final-StudentInfoSystem
An incomplete set of files used in my CS936 Final Project. The project is a college database system with a GUI front end.
Records are stored in a MySQL database in an AWS RDS instance and users can create, read, and update records with a Java GUI front end desktop client.
Specifically, users can:
1. Register or update a student with personal information like name, age, major, year, and address.
2. Similarly register or update a professor, but with info on rank and department instead.
3. Establish or update a department.
4. Create a course under a department and schedule it as a class.
5. Enroll students for classes.
6. View and add student grades for a class, and obtain a report of all the students enrolled in a class and their grades in table format.
